# Master thesis at the University of Copenhagen

This master thesis introduces a novel method for constructing confidence intervals for derived parameters of dose-response models. Utilizing the profile likelihood method with gradient information offers a reliable and efficient approach without the need for reparameterization. Through simulation studies, the thesis evaluates the performance of this method compared to traditional approaches used in fields like drug development and toxicology. 

This repository containt the final version of the thesis together with the accompanying code. The code can be easily executed in R environment.

Final grade: 12 (the highest)
